Caribbean Pirate! What’s a bad film! Little Pirate!? (气愤状)
Daddy ,this film is unfit for him , it is full of killing，force and negative passion, and it will let him become bad !
Dad, don’t let him watch so much TV, it wastes a lot of time, and it is bad for his eyesight. He may become short-sighted. (诚恳状)
